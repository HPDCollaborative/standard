# 2.0 HPD Open Standard Format Section-by-Section Guidance

- [Introduction](#introduction)

<a name="introduction"></a>
## Introduction

Each HPD section and data element is described below, along with additional guidance as needed.
The Health Product Declaration (HPD) Open Standard provides for the disclosure of product contents and potential associated human and environmental health hazards. Hazard associations are based on the HPD Priority Hazard Lists, the GreenScreen List Translator, and when available, full GreenScreen assessments.
For the purpose of an HPD disclosure, product contents include a product’s homogeneous materials (“materials”) as well as the itemized chemical substances (“substances”) that comprise each material, as defined below:

* **Material:** (Homogeneous Material) A uniform solid, liquid, or gas composed of one or more substances that cannot be mechanically disjointed, in principle. It may be a chemical formulation or compound, of undefinable composition<sup>2</sup>, or a combination of the two. Coatings and finishes such as plating, powder coats, enamels, etc. are considered unique homogeneous materials.<sup>3</sup>
* **Substance:** (Chemical Substance) Matter of constant composition, best characterized by the entities (molecules, formula units, atoms) it is composed of and its physical properties such as density, refractive index, electric conductivity, melting point, etc.<sup>4</sup> (i.e. intentionally used substances, intentional reaction products, impurities).

There are two approaches to organizing information about substances on an HPD. The instructions below describe the preferred approach, which groups substances under each material. However, it is also possible to publish a compliant HPD without grouping substances under materials or sharing any material-level information. See Variations, Basic Inventory Display [See 3.6] for supplementary instructions needed to publish an HPD using this variation.

        <p>[ 2 ] &nbsp; Materials of indefinable composition, classified by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) as Substances of Unknown or Variable
Compositions, Complex Reaction Products, or Biological Materials (UVCBs), are a mixture of unknown or variable composition, typically with an
unrefined nature and/or uncontrolled source. These substances have additional identification requirements due to their unknown or variable
composition. Identifiers such as source, manufacturing process and genetic code may be required to fully define the substance. How to list such
materials on the HPD is explained in Special Conditions for Materials and Substances [3.5].</p>
