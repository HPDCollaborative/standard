## 2.1.6.6 Expiry Date

*Date of expiration.* An HPD must contain current data and expires three years after the Screening Date [See 2.1.6.4]. HPDs also must meet the following requirements for updating:

* An HPD must be revised within one year of a significant change in a product’s contents. A significant change is defined as the addition or removal of content; a change only in Percent (%) weight does not require a revision unless it impacts whether content is present at or above the selected inventory threshold.
* When an HPD is revised, all product content must be rescreened using the current Priority Hazard Lists to update if hazard type, agency, and warning information has changed.
* HPD Format Section 3: Certifications and Compliance must also be reviewed to include updates to tests and replacement of outdated certifications.
* Upon revision, the HPD is reissued with a new screening date and publication date. An HPD expires three years after the screening date.
* A new HPD may be published or an updated HPD republished using an outdated format for up to one year after the next major version of the Standard has been released (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, etc.). However any HPD using an outdated format expires three years after the next major version of the Standard has been released (e.g., an HPD using Version 1.0 expires three years after the release of Version 2.0).
