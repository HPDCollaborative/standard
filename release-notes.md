## Acknowledgements

The HPD Collaborative Board of Directors and staff extend our deepest appreciation to the many engaged participants from a wide range of industry sectors who volunteered countless hours towards the creation of the HPDv2.0 Open Standard. 

The project was led by HPDC Staff with the support of an active Technical Committee. The Manufacturers Advisory Panel provided an immense amount of invaluable input and testing. Many individuals from design firms and other organizations provided critical feedback and design support. 

The Harmonization Task Group partners, USGBC staff, and members of the USGBCâ€™s Material Resources Technical Advisory Group (MR TAG) helped ensure that HPDv2.0 would support a harmonized approach to product inventory disclosure.
