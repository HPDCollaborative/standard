## 2.1.3.1 Content in Descending Order of Quantity

*Nested summary, in the order inventoried in HPD Format Section 2, of a product's materials, the substances in each material, each substance’s GreenScreen score, and the hazards associated with each substance.* Materials are listed from highest to lowest percentage by weight − Percent (%) − in the product. Each material has a secondary bracketed list of substances ordered from highest to lowest percentage by weight in that material. Following each substance, the associated abbreviation for the GreenScreen Benchmark or List Translator Score and the abbreviation for each hazard type, as applicable, are indicated. Refer to “GreenScreen” and “Hazard Types” in the References [See 2.6.2.1 and 2.6.2.2] for abbreviations. For clarity, each element in this summary is differentiated visually. Refer to Appendix A for the sample HPD Format to view configuration.

## 2.1.3.2 Number of GreenScreen BM-4/BM-3 contents

*Number of substances in a product, if any, that have a full GreenScreen assessment with a score of either Benchmark 4 (prefer-safer chemical) or Benchmark 3 (use but still opportunity for improvement).* Response must be substantiated by the information provided for each substance in HPD Format Section 2, GreenScreen [See 2.2.2.4].

<a name="greenscreen"></a>
## 2.1.3.3 Contents highest concern GreenScreen Benchmark or List Translator Score

*Single highest concern GreenScreen Benchmark or List Translator Score among all of the substances in a product.* Response must be substantiated by the information provided for each substance in HPD Format Section 2, GreenScreen [See 2.2.2.4].

<a name="nano"></a>
## 2.1.3.4 Nanomaterial

*An indication of whether any substances in the product have been characterized as a nanomaterial.* Refer to Glossary [See 5] for definition. Response must be substantiated by the information provided for each substance in HPD Format Section 2, Nano [See 2.2.6], and must be one of the following:

* *If any substance is identified as a nanomaterial:* “One or more contents are characterized as a nanomaterial.”
* *If all substances are identified not to be nanomaterials:* “No contents are characterized as a nanomaterial.”
* *If no substance is identified as a nanomaterial, and it is unknown whether one or more substances is a nanomaterial:* “One or more contents are characterized as unknown.”

## 2.1.3.5 Inventory and screening notes

*Explanation of information provided in HPD Format Section 1: Summary.* Extended descriptions may be continued in HPD Format Section 5: General Notes [See 2.5: General Notes] or in the allocated Notes spaces throughout HPD Format Section 2 [See 2.2.1.6: Material Notes and 2.2.2.9: Substance Notes].

Required Entries:

* explanation of each “No” answer to Characterized, Screened, and Identified [See 2.1.2.3],
* identification of each relevant Special Condition [See 3.5] and how it may influence responses to these entries (e.g., “The only Materials that are not ‘Screened’ are regarded as Special Condition(s) by the HPD Collaborative”),
* explanation when “Other” is indicated for Threshold entry [See 2.2.1.4], unless provided in the Material Notes,
* if using Basic Inventory Display, the following text must be included: "Manufacturer has opted for the basic inventory display – chemical substances are listed by weight in the entire product instead of grouped by material."

Optional Entries:

To augment the summary information in Threshold (per material) [See 2.1.2.1], and Characterized, Screened, Identified [See 2.1.2.3], this section may be used to identify the percentage of a product’s materials that correspond to particular aspects of disclosure (e.g., “Materials representing 95.0% of the product weight meet the 1,000 ppm Threshold and are Screened” or “For Materials representing 5.0% of the product weight, only MSDS level disclosure is possible because suppliers declined to provide information”).
