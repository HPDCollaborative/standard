## HPD Open Standard Format Section 1 Overview

This section contains instructions for the first page of the HPD Format:

* general information about the product and manufacturer and the HPD itself that appears in the
header and footer,
* summary information for the Content Inventory, Content in Descending Order of Quantity, Inventory and Screening Notes, VOC Content, Certifications and Compliance, and Publication. Entries in this Section are based on more detailed information provided in HPD Format Sections 2 and 3.

<hr>

<a name="general"></a>
## 2.1.1 General Information

<a name="general-product"></a>
### 2.1.1.1 Product Name

*Product brand name.* If the HPD covers multiple brands, secondary brand names are listed in the Product Description [See 2.1.1.4]. Refer to Variations, Listing Multiple Products in a Single HPD [See 3.1] for further guidance on how similar products and product lines are covered in a single HPD.

<a name="general-manufacturer"></a>
### 2.1.1.2 Manufacturer Name

*Complete name of the company responsible for the final product.* If this company is a subsidiary, the parent company is included in the Product Description [See 2.1.1.4].

<a name="general-classification"></a>
### 2.1.1.3 Classification

*Identifier associated with the product.* The six-digit Construction Specifications Institute MasterFormat ® designation is the primary and preferred identifier. Additional identifiers (e.g., Uniclass, National Building Specification, NATSPEC) may be used if there is no MasterFormat designation or may be listed in the Product Description [See 2.1.1.4]. In instances when multiple classifications apply, the primary identifier is indicated for Classification and others are listed in the Product Description or HPD Format Section 5: General Notes [See 2.5]. In instances where no classifications apply (e.g., if the HPD is for a material that is typically used as a part of a product rather than delivered for use independently), “N/A” is indicated for Classification with an explanation in the Product Description [See 2.1.1.4].

<a name="general-description"></a>
### 2.1.1.4 Product Description

*Brief description of the product.* This section is used to indicate:

<hr>

<a name="inventory"></a>
## 2.1.2 Content Inventory

<a name="content-general"></a>
### General Information for Content Inventory

A typical product’s content inventory is dependent on knowledge of information at the material level, quantified by two factors: Threshold [See 2.1.2.1] and Residuals and Impurities [See 2.1.2.2].

<a name="content-threshold"></a>
### 2.1.2.1 Threshold (per material)

*Concentration(s) above which substances present within the material are itemized by the manufacturer or supplier, as applicable.* Options include:

* “100 ppm,”
* “1,000 ppm,”
* “per GHS SDS” (Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals Safety Data Sheets),
* “per OSHA MSDS” (Occupational Safety and Health Administration Material Safety Data Sheet),
* “Other.”

Multiple thresholds may be indicated within a single HPD if different materials in HPD Format Section 2 have been itemized to different levels. Thresholds may vary depending on material supplier knowledge and willingness to share information. Refer to Inventory Threshold [See 2.2.1.4] for related guidance.

<a name="content-materials"></a>
### 2.1.2.2 Residuals and Impurities Considered in X of Y Materials

*Number of materials in a product that include consideration of residuals and impurities (“X”) as compared to the total number of materials (“Y”).* An explanation is required and may be located in HPD Format Section 2: Material Notes [See 2.2.1.6] and/or Section 5: General Notes [See 2.5] as indicated by the selection of “see Section 2: Material Notes” and/or “see Section 5: General Notes.” Explanations that apply to a specific material should be in Material Notes; explanations that apply to the entire product or multiple materials should be in General Notes. Refer to Residuals/Impurities [See 2.2.1.5] for related guidance.

<a name="content-identified"></a>
### 2.1.2.3 Characterized, Screened, Identified

*Summary of the degree of disclosure of unambiguous data in the product’s content inventory.*

* **Characterized:** Are the Percent Weight and Role provided for all substances?
* **Screened:** Are all substances screened using Priority Hazard Lists with results disclosed?
* **Identified:** Are all substances disclosed by Name (Specific or Generic) and Identifier?

For each of the above items:

* “Yes” indicates the response is true for all substances inventoried, based on the selected Inventory Threshold [See 2.2.1.4] for each material.
* “No” indicates the response is not true for one or more substances inventoried, based on the selected Inventory Threshold for each material.

This summary applies to each individual substance present in each material at or above that material’s Inventory Threshold [See 2.2.1.4] unless specifically allowed otherwise by the instructions in Variations, Special Conditions for Materials and Substances [See 3.5].

<hr>

<a name="content"></a>
## 2.1.3 Content in Descending Order of Quantity

<a name="quantity-order"></a>
### 2.1.3.1 Content in Descending Order of Quantity

*Nested summary, in the order inventoried in HPD Format Section 2, of a product's materials, the substances in each material, each substance’s GreenScreen score, and the hazards associated with each substance.* Materials are listed from highest to lowest percentage by weight − Percent (%) − in the product. Each material has a secondary bracketed list of substances ordered from highest to lowest percentage by weight in that material. Following each substance, the associated abbreviation for the GreenScreen Benchmark or List Translator Score and the abbreviation for each hazard type, as applicable, are indicated. Refer to “GreenScreen” and “Hazard Types” in the References [See 2.6.2.1 and 2.6.2.2] for abbreviations. For clarity, each element in this summary is differentiated visually. Refer to Appendix A for the sample HPD Format to view configuration.

<a name="quantity-contents"></a>
### 2.1.3.2 Number of GreenScreen BM-4/BM-3 contents

*Number of substances in a product, if any, that have a full GreenScreen assessment with a score of either Benchmark 4 (prefer-safer chemical) or Benchmark 3 (use but still opportunity for improvement).* Response must be substantiated by the information provided for each substance in HPD Format Section 2, GreenScreen [See 2.2.2.4].

<a name="quantity-greenscreen"></a>
### 2.1.3.3 Contents highest concern GreenScreen Benchmark or List Translator Score

*Single highest concern GreenScreen Benchmark or List Translator Score among all of the substances in a product.* Response must be substantiated by the information provided for each substance in HPD Format Section 2, GreenScreen [See 2.2.2.4].

<a name="quantity-nano"></a>
### 2.1.3.4 Nanomaterial

*An indication of whether any substances in the product have been characterized as a nanomaterial.* Refer to Glossary [See 5] for definition. Response must be substantiated by the information provided for each substance in HPD Format Section 2, Nano [See 2.2.6], and must be one of the following:

* *If any substance is identified as a nanomaterial:* “One or more contents are characterized as a nanomaterial.”
* *If all substances are identified not to be nanomaterials:* “No contents are characterized as a nanomaterial.”
* *If no substance is identified as a nanomaterial, and it is unknown whether one or more substances is a nanomaterial:* “One or more contents are characterized as unknown.”

<a name="quantity-notes"></a>
### 2.1.3.5 Inventory and screening notes

*Explanation of information provided in HPD Format Section 1: Summary.* Extended descriptions may be continued in HPD Format Section 5: General Notes [See 2.5: General Notes] or in the allocated Notes spaces throughout HPD Format Section 2 [See 2.2.1.6: Material Notes and 2.2.2.9: Substance Notes].

Required Entries:

* explanation of each “No” answer to Characterized, Screened, and Identified [See 2.1.2.3],
* identification of each relevant Special Condition [See 3.5] and how it may influence responses to these entries (e.g., “The only Materials that are not ‘Screened’ are regarded as Special Condition(s) by the HPD Collaborative”),
* explanation when “Other” is indicated for Threshold entry [See 2.2.1.4], unless provided in the Material Notes,
* if using Basic Inventory Display, the following text must be included: "Manufacturer has opted for the basic inventory display – chemical substances are listed by weight in the entire product instead of grouped by material."

Optional Entries:

To augment the summary information in Threshold (per material) [See 2.1.2.1], and Characterized, Screened, Identified [See 2.1.2.3], this section may be used to identify the percentage of a product’s materials that correspond to particular aspects of disclosure (e.g., “Materials representing 95.0% of the product weight meet the 1,000 ppm Threshold and are Screened” or “For Materials representing 5.0% of the product weight, only MSDS level disclosure is possible because suppliers declined to provide information”).

### 2.1.4.2 Regulatory (g/l)

*Numerical value of Regulatory VOC content<sup>6</sup>, also referred to as “Coating” content.*

Regulatory VOC content compares regulated, or non-exempt, VOCs against non-exempt volume. Water and exempt solvents are not included. If the product is a Low Solids Coating<sup>7</sup>, “N/A” is indicated here.

<a name="voc-exempt"></a>
### 2.1.4.3 Does the product contain exempt VOCs?

*Indication of whether the product includes VOCs that are exempted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).*

* “Yes” indicates the product contains VOCs that are exempted by EPA from regulatory reporting and therefore will not be included in the VOC content totals<sup>8</sup>.
* “No” indicates the product does not contain EPA exempt VOCs.
* If the product contains a substance that is an exempt VOC, “Exempt VOC” must be noted in the HPD Format Section 2 Substance Notes [See 2.2.2.9] for the corresponding substance.

<a name="voc-tints"></a>
### 2.1.4.4 Are ultra-low VOC tints available?

*Indication for tintable products of whether ultra-low VOC tints may be available at the point of retail sale.* For tintable products:

* “Yes” indicates product is tintable and tints that meet the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) Super Compliant Coatings definition<sup>9</sup> and/or Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidance for VOC free claims<sup>10</sup> are offered by the manufacturer to distributors for this product, resulting in the addition of less than 10 g/L of VOC content for any combination of tints. The tinting system is included as an accessory in Section 4: Accessories [See 2.4]. The name of the tinting system and how to obtain it must be provided as an “other” Note [See 2.4.3].

<a name="pub-screening"></a>
### 2.1.6.4 Screening Date

*Date of hazard screening.* This must reflect the date of the final screening for all substances listed in the HPD against the HPD Priority Hazard Lists to identify relevant Warnings to disclose in the HPD.

<a name="pub-release"></a>
### 2.1.6.5 Release Date

*Date of publication.* This must reflect the date on which the HPD is made publicly available.

<a name="pub-expiry"></a>
### 2.1.6.6 Expiry Date

*Date of expiration.* An HPD must contain current data and expires three years after the Screening Date [See 2.1.6.4]. HPDs also must meet the following requirements for updating:

* An HPD must be revised within one year of a significant change in a product’s contents. A significant change is defined as the addition or removal of content; a change only in Percent (%) weight does not require a revision unless it impacts whether content is present at or above the selected inventory threshold.
* When an HPD is revised, all product content must be rescreened using the current Priority Hazard Lists to update if hazard type, agency, and warning information has changed.
* HPD Format Section 3: Certifications and Compliance must also be reviewed to include updates to tests and replacement of outdated certifications.
* Upon revision, the HPD is reissued with a new screening date and publication date. An HPD expires three years after the screening date.
* A new HPD may be published or an updated HPD republished using an outdated format for up to one year after the next major version of the Standard has been released (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, etc.). However any HPD using an outdated format expires three years after the next major version of the Standard has been released (e.g., an HPD using Version 1.0 expires three years after the release of Version 2.0).

        <p>[ 5 ] &nbsp; Actual/Material VOC and Regulatory VOC are measures of VOC content that may be determined by either calculation or by testing. Acceptable methodologies include EPA Method 24 (calculated or tested) or ASTM D6886 testing (direct GC/MS determination) or as per the guidance given in California Air Resources Board (CARB) 2007 Suggested Control Measure for Architectural Coatings or South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) Rule 1113, Rule 1168, or appropriate international methodology in use.</p>
        <p>[ 6 ] &nbsp; This is a measure used by many regulatory agencies and is generally higher than “material” or “as supplied” VOC content.</p>
        <p>[ 7 ] &nbsp; For Low Solids Coatings only the “Actual” VOC content is calculated for regulatory purposes. CARB Suggested Control Measure for Architectural Coatings: http://www.arb.ca.gov/coatings/arch/Approved_2007_SCM.pdf</p>
        <p>[ 8 ] &nbsp; Exempted compounds refers to VOC compounds such as acetone and methylene chloride that EPA and some other governmental regulatory agencies exempt from smog-related reporting regulations because the chemicals are not reactive in the atmosphere and hence do not contribute to formation of ground level ozone, though they may be hazardous to human health if inhaled. The EPA list of exempted chemicals is listed in Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 40, Section 51.100, subsection (s)(1). If the product contains exempt VOCs, these must be disclosed in the corresponding Section 2 chemical substance line item.</p>
