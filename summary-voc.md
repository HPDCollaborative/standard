## General Information on VOCs

The information that follows in Sections 2.1.4.1 – 2.1.4.3 must be provided for all liquid/wet- applied products.

If the HPD is for a product that is not liquid/wet applied, the following phrase is inserted in lieu of the entries in this sub-section: "VOC content data is not applicable for this product category."

<a name="material"></a>
## 2.1.4.1 Material (g/l)

*Numerical value of Actual/Material VOC content as the product is supplied.* This is sometimes referred to as “VOCs as supplied” or “Applied VOCs.”[5]

<a name="regs"></a>
## 2.1.4.2 Regulatory (g/l)

*Numerical value of Regulatory VOC content[6], also referred to as “Coating” content.*

Regulatory VOC content compares regulated, or non-exempt, VOCs against non-exempt volume. Water and exempt solvents are not included. If the product is a Low Solids Coating[7], “N/A” is indicated here.

<a name="exempt"></a>
## 2.1.4.3 Does the product contain exempt VOCs?

*Indication of whether the product includes VOCs that are exempted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).*

* “Yes” indicates the product contains VOCs that are exempted by EPA from regulatory reporting and therefore will not be included in the VOC content totals[8].
* “No” indicates the product does not contain EPA exempt VOCs.
* If the product contains a substance that is an exempt VOC, “Exempt VOC” must be noted in the HPD Format Section 2 Substance Notes [See 2.2.2.9] for the corresponding substance.

<a name="tints"></a>
## 2.1.4.4 Are ultra-low VOC tints available?

*Indication for tintable products of whether ultra-low VOC tints may be available at the point of retail sale.* For tintable products:

* “Yes” indicates product is tintable and tints that meet the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) Super Compliant Coatings definition[9] and/or Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidance for VOC free claims[10] are offered by the manufacturer to distributors for this product, resulting in the addition of less than 10 g/L of VOC content for any combination of tints. The tinting system is included as an accessory in Section 4: Accessories [See 2.4]. The name of the tinting system and how to obtain it must be provided as an “other” Note [See 2.4.3].
* “No” indicates ultra-low tints are not available from distributors of this product.
* “N/A” indicates the product is not tintable at the point of retail sale.

        <p>[ 5 ] &nbsp; Actual/Material VOC and Regulatory VOC are measures of VOC content that may be determined by either calculation or by testing. Acceptable methodologies include EPA Method 24 (calculated or tested) or ASTM D6886 testing (direct GC/MS determination) or as per the guidance given in California Air Resources Board (CARB) 2007 Suggested Control Measure for Architectural Coatings or South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) Rule 1113, Rule 1168, or appropriate international methodology in use.</p>
        <p>[ 6 ] &nbsp; This is a measure used by many regulatory agencies and is generally higher than “material” or “as supplied” VOC content.</p>
        <p>[ 7 ] &nbsp; For Low Solids Coatings only the “Actual” VOC content is calculated for regulatory purposes. CARB Suggested Control Measure for Architectural Coatings: http://www.arb.ca.gov/coatings/arch/Approved_2007_SCM.pdf</p>
        <p>[ 8 ] &nbsp; Exempted compounds refers to VOC compounds such as acetone and methylene chloride that EPA and some other governmental regulatory agencies exempt from smog-related reporting regulations because the chemicals are not reactive in the atmosphere and hence do not contribute to formation of ground level ozone, though they may be hazardous to human health if inhaled. The EPA list of exempted chemicals is listed in Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 40, Section 51.100, subsection (s)(1). If the product contains exempt VOCs, these must be disclosed in the corresponding Section 2 chemical substance line item.</p>
