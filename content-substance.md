## General Information on Substances

Each substance in a material is included with its own line item entry. Substances should be listed in descending order of quantity within the material.

<a name="name"></a>
## 2.2.2.1 Substance Name

*Title of the substance.* Options include the substance’s specific name, generic name, “Undisclosed” or “Unknown.”

* If the manufacturer chooses to identify the substance to a lesser degree of specificity, a generic name or chemical class may be indicated in its place.
* If the manufacturer chooses not to disclose the name of the substance in any fashion, “Undisclosed” must be indicated, with explanation of the rationale for nondisclosure in the Substance Notes [See 2.2.2.9], and the product cannot be indicated as “Identified” [See 2.2.2.2] unless specifically allowed by the instructions in Variations, Special Conditions for Materials and Substances [See 3.5].
* If the manufacturer does not know the substance name, “Unknown” must be indicated. This is possible when the material supplier has passed on content characteristics to the product manufacturer for inclusion in the HPD, but has redacted certain details. Efforts undertaken to identify the substance must be explained in the Substance Notes [See 2.2.2.9], and the product cannot be indicated as “Identified” [See 2.2.2.2] unless specifically allowed by the instructions in Variations, Special Conditions for Materials and Substances [See 3.5].

<a name="identifier"></a>
## 2.2.2.2 Identifier

*Chemical Abstract Service Registration Number (CAS RN or CAS number) or other substance identification<sup>14</sup>.* Refer to Glossary [See 5] for definition. Refer to Variations, Special Conditions for Materials and Substances [See 3.5] for further guidance on identifiers other than CAS numbers.

* “Undisclosed” indicates that the manufacturer knows the identifier and chooses not to disclose. The rationale for non-disclosure must be explained in the Substance Notes [See 2.2.2.9] and the product cannot be indicated as “Identified” [See 2.2.2.2] unless specifically allowed by the instructions in Variations, Special Conditions for Materials and Substances [See 3.5].
* “Unknown” indicates that the manufacturer does not know the chemical identity. An explanation of why it is unknown and manufacturer efforts to identify it must be included in the Substance Notes [See 2.2.2.9], and the product cannot be indicated as “Identified” [See 2.2.2.2] unless specifically allowed by the instructions in Variations, Special Conditions for Materials and Substances [See 3.5].
* If more than one identifier has been assigned to this substance, other relevant identifiers may be listed in the Substance Notes [See 2.2.2.9].
* “Not registered” indicates no CAS number or other identifier has been registered for this substance.

<a name="percent"></a>
## 2.2.2.3 Percent (%)

*Substance's percentage in the material by weight.* For the following instances, the same guidance applies as for “Percent” (%) [See 2.2.1.2] in the Material section above, with explanation entered in the Substance Notes [See 2.2.2.9] instead of the Material Notes [See 2.2.1.6]:

* ranges, variable amounts over time;
* ranges, similar products;
* alternate substances;
* undisclosed.

If “Undisclosed” is selected for any substance in the product, the product may not be indicated as “Characterized” [See 2.1.2.3].

<a name="greenscreen"></a>
## 2.2.2.4 GreenScreen (GS)

*Benchmark or List Translator scores.* Options from highest to lowest concern are: BM-1, LT- 1, LT-P1, LT-UNK, UNK, BM-U, BM-2, BM-3, BM-4. Refer to References [See 2.6.2.2] for definition and an explanation of each score.

Substances that are present on one or more screening or authoritative hazard list are assigned a List Translator score (“LT-1” or “LT-P1”or “LT-UNK”). Substances not present on any list are assigned an “UNK” score. A full GreenScreen assessment is not required to generate a List Translator score. If the substance has received a full GreenScreen assessment published in the Pharos Chemical and Material Library, the Benchmark score is indicated instead of the List Translator score, with explanation in the Substance Notes [See 2.2.2.9], of the source of the full GreenScreen assessment. Any certified full GreenScreen assessment that is completed by a Licensed GreenScreen Profiler and licensed for public use may be submitted for inclusion in the Pharos Chemical and Material Library at no cost. Refer to Variations, Special Conditions for Materials and Substances [See 3.5] for further guidance about Form Specific Hazards.

A GreenScreen assessment certified by a Licensed GreenScreen Profiler for which the manufacturer holds license to make public claims, but which is not published in the Pharos Chemical and Material Library, may be listed in the Substance Notes [2.2.2.9]. Include the GreenScreen Benchmark, the name of the Licensed GreenScreen Profiler certifying the assessment, and the date of the assessment. For example: “This substance was assigned GreenScreen Benchmark 3 by Licensed GreenScreen Profiler xxxx on March 3, 2015.”

<a name="content"></a>
## 2.2.2.5 RC: Recycled content

*Indication of whether the substance was diverted from a waste stream for use in the material.*

* For substances with recycled content, “PostC” indicates postconsumer recycled content, and “PreC” indicates preconsumer (post-industrial) recycled content. Refer to Glossary [See 5] for definitions.
* “Both” indicates the substance includes both postconsumer and preconsumer (post- industrial) recycled content.
* “None” indicates the substance does not include pre- or postconsumer recycled content.
* “Unk” indicates the inclusion of recycled content is unknown.

For each substance with recycled content, the Substance Notes [See 2.2.2.9] must indicate the type of product(s) from which the recycled content is obtained. (Example: for postconsumer recycled high-density polyethylene, the Substance Notes would document sourcing as from recycled milk bottles, grocery bags, or other products.) Refer to Variations, Special Conditions for Materials and Substances [See 3.5] for further guidance about substances that include recycled content of mixed composition.

<a name="nano"></a>
## 2.2.2.6 Nano

*Indication of whether the substance is a nanomaterial.* Refer to Glossary [See 5] for definition.

* “YES” indicates the substance is a nanomaterial.
* “NO” indicates it is not a nanomaterial.
* “UNK” indicates that it is unknown whether the substance is a nanomaterial or not.

<a name="role"></a>
## 2.2.2.7 Role

*Brief phrase that captures the substance’s purpose or function for inclusion in the material.*

Examples include: "binder," "anti-microbial," "flame retardant," "wear layer," "catalyst," "preservative," etc. Further explanation of a particular substance can be included in the Substance Notes [See 2.2.2.9]. The role for each substance must be identified in order for the product to be indicated as “Characterized” [See 2.1.2.3].

<a name="hazards"></a>
## 2.2.2.8 Hazards, Agency(ies) with Warnings

Hazard types, agencies, and warnings associated with a substance as identified by the Health Product Declaration Priority Hazard Lists. Each substance must be screened against the Priority Hazard Lists to determine if the substance is listed. The required Priority Hazard Lists are identified in Appendix D - HPD Priority List Sources. Some lists address multiple hazard types. Refer to Appendix E - HPD Priority List Warnings for the list of the Hazard Warnings required to be scanned when screening a substance.

If the substance is listed, indicate the associated Hazard Type under Hazards, and the Agency List Abbreviation and Hazard Warning separated by a colon (“:”) under Agencies with Warnings as per the standardized forms in Appendix E - HPD Priority List Warnings. There must be a separate line item entry for each Hazard Type for which a substance is listed. If there is more than one Agency and Warning related to a single Hazard Type, add “also in” followed by each of the relevant Agency List Abbreviations.

* Hazard type, agency, and warning information may be manually compiled or obtained through an automated compilation tool. Use of a comprehensive automated compilation tool is recommended to ensure these associations are made accurately and efficiently. The compilation method used to identify hazard type, agency, and warnings must include all relevant information from each of the HPD Priority Hazard Lists. If it does not, the manufacturer must insert information from missing lists. It is the manufacturer’s responsibility to confirm that the compilation method selected is current and comprehensive and that information in the tool is updated at least annually.
* If the substance is not present by name or CAS number on any of the Priority Hazard Lists, then a search by synonyms (name or additional CAS numbers) must be conducted. If still not found, “None found” is indicated for Hazards and “No warnings found on HPD Priority Hazard Lists” is indicated for Agency(ies) with Warnings.
* If a single List has shown that there are multiple hazard types for a substance, but has not specified which particular hazard types apply, “Multiple” is indicated for the Hazards.
* Hazards, agencies, and warnings, if any, must be provided for all known and itemized substances, regardless of whether the substance’s name and CAS number have been disclosed. Confidential Business Information status is not an acceptable reason to avoid disclosure of hazards, agencies, and warnings.
* If the substance identity is proprietary to a supplier and neither the identity nor the hazard, agency, and warning information have been disclosed to the manufacturer, “Unknown” is indicated for Hazard, and “Not disclosed by supplier” is indicated for Agency(ies) with Warnings. An explanation must be provided in the Substance Notes [See 2.2.2.9] regarding efforts to obtain this information from the supplier.
* Refer to Variations, Special Conditions for Materials and Substances [See 3.5] for further guidance about how hazard types, agencies, and warnings are documented in certain specific instances.

## 2.2.2.9 Substance Notes

*Explanation of the substance’s characteristics.*

Required entries are:

* explanation if Substance Name [See 2.2.2.1] and Identifier [See 2.2.2.2] are
“Undisclosed” or “Unknown.” The manufacturer must explain the rationale for nondisclosure for “Undisclosed” substances and efforts undertaken to identify “Unknown” substances. The manufacturer is encouraged to indicate if there is a time horizon for the non-disclosure (e.g., a pending patent application filing or other limited time intellectual protection or market advantage issue), and the existence of and time limits associated with a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) in place with the supplier; additional CAS numbers, if the substance can be identified by multiple CAS numbers;
* explanation if GreenScreen assessment is referenced which is not published in Pharos Chemical and Material Library [see 2.2.2.4];
* explanation for ranges, alternates and undisclosed substance percentage as required in 2.2.2.3 Percent (%);
