## HPD Open Standard Format Section 3 Overview

This section lists independent certifications to verify key content and health-related product characteristics. This includes applicable certification and standards compliance information for VOC emissions and VOC content. Other types of health or environmental performance testing or certifications completed for the product may be provided at the manufacturer’s discretion. Multi- attribute certification programs may be listed here (e.g., Cradle-to-Cradle CertifiedTM, SMaRT, level®). In addition to listing third party certifications, this space may also be used to list a self- declared claim of adherence to an independent standard.

## 2.3.1 General Requirements

Certification or testing is not required for completion of the HPD. However, an entry is required for VOC Emissions for all products [See 2.3.3.1], and an entry is required for VOC Content for wet- applied products [See 2.3.3.2]. VOC Emissions is always listed first. VOC content, when applicable, is listed second. Refer to Name of Certification or Compliance [See 2.3.3].

A multi-attribute certification program may only be used to document compliance for VOC Emissions, VOC Content, or other specific criteria if either the program requires a certain minimum level of performance (e.g., ANSI/NSF 140-2007e – Gold for VOC Emissions), or there is a published scorecard demonstrating that the product met a specific level of performance (e.g., the MTS SMaRT Building Product Standard if the Minimize Indoor Air Criterion has been met for VOC emissions).

Other product certifications and standards not directly related to content and health should not be included here. Listing of certifications and standards relating to other product attributes may be included in HPD Format Section 5: General Notes [See 2.5].

The HPD does not provide a structure for claims about a product’s compliance with construction project level rating system requirements (e.g., LEED®, BREEAM®, Living Building ChallengeTM, Sustainable Sites InitiativeTM, WELL Building Standard®). Claims about a product’s compliance with such rating system requirements may be listed in HPD Format Section 5: General Notes [See 2.5], and must be explicit about the specific requirement, the applicable program version, and any special conditions of compliance.

### 2.3.3.1 VOC Emissions

* If the product has been certified under a program that requires California Department of Public Health (CDPH) Standard Method<sup>16</sup> compliant VOC emissions testing (e.g., Indoor Advantage GoldTM, FloorScore®, or GREENGUARD Gold), that certification must be indicated along with the building type scenario applied if other than the combined office and schools (e.g., “SCS Indoor AdvantageTM Gold - Residential”) and any other special qualifications associated with the certification or standard compliance, such as “formaldehyde free.”
* If the product has not been certified under a program that uses the CDPH Standard Method but has been tested by an independent laboratory against the CDPH Standard Method and passed, that test must be indicated along with the building type scenario applied (e.g., “CDPH Standard Method V1.1 – residential scenario”) and any other special qualifications associated with the certification or standard compliance, such as “formaldehyde free.” Note that at this time the CDPH Standard Method lists emissions scenarios only for insulation and interior products but also includes provisions for adapting the loading scenarios to certain other product categories. See Appendix F for details. Add "Adapted loading" to the Certification and Compliance Notes [See 2.3.10], if the product has been tested using applicable CDPH Standard Method provisions for adapting scenarios to other product categories.
* If the product has been certified or tested against the international emissions standard AgBB [see Appendix F], that certification or standard must be indicated along with any special qualifications associated with the certification or standard compliance.
* If the product has not been certified or tested against the CDPH Standard Method or AgBB:
    * If the current version of the CDPH Standard Method does not provide an appropriate emissions scenario for the product type, and the product type cannot be tested using applicable CDPH Standard Method provisions for adapting the scenarios, “N/A” must be indicated. Note that there is no emissions scenario for exterior products.
    * If the current version of the CDPH Standard Method provides an appropriate emissions scenario for the product type, or the product type can be tested using applicable CDPH Standard Method provisions for adapting the scenarios, “CDPH Standard Method – Not tested” must be indicated.
    * If the manufacturer is in the process of having the product tested, an explanation may be provided in the Certification and Compliance Notes [See 2.3.10] of when testing or certification results are anticipated.
    * If the product meets LEED® criteria for an “inherently non-emitting source” “Inherently non-emitting source per LEED®” is indicated.<sup>17</sup>
    * In addition to the first listing referring to CDPH Standard Method or AgBB as outlined above, if a product has been certified or tested against an emissions test method that is not based on CDPH Standard Method or AgBB, that certification or test method may be listed second. For certifications, list the test method in the Certification and Compliance Notes [See 2.3.10].

### 2.3.3.2 VOC Content

An entry is required for VOC Content for any product, interior or exterior, that is wet/liquid- applied on site (e.g., paints, adhesives and other coatings). For product categories that are not wet/liquid-applied, VOC Content is not applicable, and no entry is expected.

* If the product has received a certification that addresses VOC content levels, or a third party laboratory certificate for VOC content testing, the name of that certification or test method is indicated.
* If the product is compliant with one or more of the regulatory standards applicable to the product category that limit VOC content, such as SCAQMD Rule 1168, SCAQMD Rule 1113 or the CARB 2007 Suggested Control Measure for Architectural Coatings, the name of each applicable standard with which the product complies is indicated.
* Otherwise, reference the standard that was used to determine Actual [2.1.15] and Regulatory [2.1.16] VOC content values.

## 2.3.4 Certifying Party

*Type of party that is attesting to the claim.* Options include:

* Self-declared: claim made by the manufacturer (First Party). This also includes tests by an outside laboratory if a third party is not certifying the sample selection and chain of custody.
* Second Party: claim certified by a trade association or other interested party.
* Third Party: claim certified by an independent third party or audited/inspected by a government agency. A test result from an independent outside laboratory does not qualify the claim as third party certified. For a certification program to qualify as Third Party, a third party certifier must manage the chain of custody for sample selection and approve adherence to the standard.

<a name="lab"></a>
## 2.3.7 Certifier or Lab

*Name of the certifying body or laboratory.* For a second or third party certification, the name of the certifier must be provided. For a self-declared claim using an independent laboratory, the name of the laboratory that did the testing must be provided. “None” indicates no outside testing was done to validate the manufacturer claim.

<hr>

<a name="facility"></a>
## 2.3.8 Applicable Facilities

*Location(s) of specific manufacturing facilities for which the standard or certification applies, including the city, state, and country.* “All” indicates that all of the manufacturer’s facilities are covered by this standard or certification.
