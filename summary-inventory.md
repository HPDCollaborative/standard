## General Information for Content Inventory

A typical product’s content inventory is dependent on knowledge of information at the material level, quantified by two factors: Threshold [See 2.1.2.1] and Residuals and Impurities [See 2.1.2.2].

<a name="threshold"></a>
## 2.1.2.1 Threshold (per material)

*Concentration(s) above which substances present within the material are itemized by the manufacturer or supplier, as applicable.* Options include:

* “100 ppm,”
* “1,000 ppm,”
* “per GHS SDS” (Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals Safety Data Sheets),
* “per OSHA MSDS” (Occupational Safety and Health Administration Material Safety Data Sheet),
* “Other.”

Multiple thresholds may be indicated within a single HPD if different materials in HPD Format Section 2 have been itemized to different levels. Thresholds may vary depending on material supplier knowledge and willingness to share information. Refer to Inventory Threshold [See 2.2.1.4] for related guidance.

## 2.1.2.2 Residuals and Impurities Considered in X of Y Materials

*Number of materials in a product that include consideration of residuals and impurities (“X”) as compared to the total number of materials (“Y”).* An explanation is required and may be located in HPD Format Section 2: Material Notes [See 2.2.1.6] and/or Section 5: General Notes [See 2.5] as indicated by the selection of “see Section 2: Material Notes” and/or “see Section 5: General Notes.” Explanations that apply to a specific material should be in Material Notes; explanations that apply to the entire product or multiple materials should be in General Notes. Refer to Residuals/Impurities [See 2.2.1.5] for related guidance.

## 2.1.2.3 Characterized, Screened, Identified

*Summary of the degree of disclosure of unambiguous data in the product’s content inventory.*

* **Characterized:** Are the Percent Weight and Role provided for all substances?
* **Screened:** Are all substances screened using Priority Hazard Lists with results disclosed?
* **Identified:** Are all substances disclosed by Name (Specific or Generic) and Identifier?

For each of the above items:

* “Yes” indicates the response is true for all substances inventoried, based on the selected Inventory Threshold [See 2.2.1.4] for each material.
* “No” indicates the response is not true for one or more substances inventoried, based on the selected Inventory Threshold for each material.

This summary applies to each individual substance present in each material at or above that material’s Inventory Threshold [See 2.2.1.4] unless specifically allowed otherwise by the instructions in Variations, Special Conditions for Materials and Substances [See 3.5].
