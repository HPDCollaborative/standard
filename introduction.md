## Introduction

The Health Product Declaration (HPD) Open Standard provides for the disclosure of product contents and potential associated human and environmental health hazards. Hazard associations are based on the HPD Priority Hazard Lists, the GreenScreen List Translator, and when available, full GreenScreen assessments. The HPD Open Standard consists of two components:

* The HPD Open Standard Format (HPD Format) is a consistent structural framework for the presentation of data elements required for a Health Product Declaration.
* The HPD Open Standard Instructions (HPD Instructions) define the terms and requirements for the data elements included in the Standard Format.

A disclosure completed in compliance with the HPD Open Standard is referred to as a “Health Product Declaration,” or “HPD.”

<a name="purpose"></a>
## 1.1 Purpose

This document provides both the Instructions required to prepare a Health Product Declaration (HPD) and the HPD Format in Appendix A.
The Instructions include:

* HPD Format section-by-section guidance that defines and explains requirements for each data
element,
* variations that expand on the section guidance to create a compliant HPD in specific
situations,
* checklist for a compliant HPD, to assist users in ensuring completeness and compliance,
* glossary of terms and programs cited,
* Appendices B-E that provide supplementary information needed to ensure hazard screenings
can be completed whatever method for preparing an HPD is used.

<a name="scope"></a>
## 1.2 Scope

The Health Product Declaration Open Standard is the only authoritative reference for preparation of a Health Product Declaration.

<a name="exclusions"></a>
## 1.3 HPD Open Standard Exclusions

The HPD Open Standard does not:

* provide an assessment of health impacts throughout the product life cycle,
* provide an assessment of exposure or risk associated with product handling or use1,
* address potential health impacts of: (i) substances used or created during the manufacturing
process unless they remain in the final product, or (ii) substances created after the product is delivered for end use (e.g., if the product burns, degrades, or otherwise changes chemical composition).

> {note} 1. See HPD Collaborative website for definitions and discussion of these terms.

## 1.4 Preparing an HPD

An HPD is to be prepared by the product’s manufacturer. The manufacturer may obtain third party assistance, if desired. To facilitate the preparation of an HPD and to further support quality engagement of users and creators of HPDs, the HPD Collaborative website provides tools and additional information, including guidance to support different methods for preparing an HPD. HPD Collaborative tools are aligned and consistent with the HPD Open Standard and, when used together with the HPD Open Standard, assist the manufacturer in creating a complete and standard-compliant HPD. Users are also encouraged to review the FAQs and Emerging Best Practices.

An HPD must contain current data. Requirements for updating are addressed in HPD Format Section 1, Summary, Expiry Date [See 2.1.6.6].

## 1.5 About the HPD Collaborative

The HPD Open Standard was created and is maintained and evolved by the Health Product Declaration Collaborative (the HPD Collaborative), a customer-led organization composed of stakeholders throughout the building industry. The HPD Collaborative is committed to the continuous improvement of building products through transparency, openness, and innovation throughout the product supply chain.
